                <p>Jellyfish are not a clade, as they include most of the Medusozoa, barring some of the Hydrozoa. The medusozoan groups included by authorities are indicated on the following phylogenetic tree by the presence of citations. Names of included jellyfish, in English where possible, are shown in boldface; the presence of a named and cited example indicates that at least that species within its group has been called a jellyfish.</p>

                <h4>Species</h4>
                <p>There are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 20 species of Cubozoa, and the Hydrozoa includes about 1000–1500 species that produce medusae, but many more species that do not.</p>

                <p>Since jellyfish have no hard parts, fossils are rare. The oldest conulariid scyphozoans appeared between 635 and 577 mya in the Neoproterozoic of the Lantian Formation in China; others are found in the youngest Ediacaran rocks of the Tamengo Formation of Brazil, c. 505 mya, through to the Triassic. Cubozoans and hydrozoans appeared in the Cambrian of the Marjum Formation in Utah, USA, c. 540 mya.</p>

                <p>
                    Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.
                    Neon is the second lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: <sup>20</sup>Ne (90.48%), <sup>21</sup>Ne (0.27%) and <sup>22</sup>Ne (9.25%).

                <h4>Applications</h4>
                <p>
                    Neon gas is used in gas discharge lamps. When electricity goes through the neon, it lights up red. Due to this quality, it is used in signs. Similar signs use other gases to make other colors, but they are also often called "neon signs".

                    The word "neon" comes from the Greek word meaning "new". It was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers in 1898.
                    Neon does not react with other elements, so it is found by itself. There is not much neon in the air, and it is clear, so we do not see it.

                     Skateboarding is as well as a recreational activity, an art form, a entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation.
                     Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years

                <p>
                    With the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels ("wheelie" or "manual"), spinning only on the back wheels (a "pivot"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a "hippie jump", long jumping from one board to another.

                    The world's first recorded long distance road trip by automobile took place in Germany in August 1888 when Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl Benz, the inventor of the first patented motor car (the Benz Patent-Motorwagen), travelled from Mannheim to Pforzheim (a distance of 106 km (66 mi)).

                <h4>Recreational Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                    Many people may go on road trips for recreational purpose (e.g. sightseeing or to reach a desired location, typically during a vacation period (e.g., in the US, driving to Disneyland from Oregon)). Other motivations for long distance travel by automobile include visitation of relatives, who may live far away, or relocation of one's permanent living space.

                    Generally, while road trips can occur in any mass of land, large masses of land are most common for road trips. The most popular locations for road trips include Canada, Mainland U.S., and Central Europe.

                    It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas are now a consumer product with a large global market.

                <p>
                    Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed.

                    Umbrellas continue to be actively developed. In the US, so many umbrella-related patents are being filed that the U.S. Patent Office employs four full-time examiners to assess them. As of 2008, the office registered 3000 active patents on umbrella-related inventions.
